[{"meta":{"postedOn":"6/13/2013","id":1},"entry":{"title":"Growing Pains.","body":"I am a little over a month into my internship and so far I love it. I have been able to work on exciting projects and have been learning the ins and out of what developers do in the real world. That being said, if one were to ask me to some up the experience so far I would respond \"growing pains\".\n\nLearning new technologies and getting into the swing of things have really opened my eyes. The real world isn't fun and games like at college where you can stay up till 3 a.m. programming some hobby project (not that I expected it to be fun & games).\n\nIt is crazy how the summer is half over already but hopefully I can put my remaining time here to good use."}}]
